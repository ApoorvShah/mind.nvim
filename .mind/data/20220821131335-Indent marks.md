# Indent marks

Currently, I’m relying on a plugin to draw indent marks, which is not ideal because not everyone will have the indent
marks. Instead, it should be super simple to create them manually.

For anything a line that is not a parent, we want to insert │ every cycle of indentation.
For when it’s a parent, want └.
